Optimisation in Bigcommerce

1.  Optimise Images:
Compress images using tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim.
Use the correct image format (e.g., WebP for web images).

2. Limit third-party resources:
BigCommerce may recommend several third-party resources to every business, but too many of them can affect loading speed. 
This is because many of them make heavy use of Javascript. They’re also often unoptimised in terms of images and videos. Alongside, they can cause blockages in the correct rendering of a webpage. 
3. Make use of automatic redirects:
Automatic redirects are again another huge aspect of your BigCommerce speed  efforts. 
They ensure your visitors don’t see error pages if they somehow click or type out a dated URL or wrong domain name. 
To set up automatic redirects for your BigCommerce store:
Go to server settings on the left side of your dashboard
Go to “Add redirects” under the topic “301 redirects
Adjust the old URL link to flow into the new URL link
BigCommerce allows stores to do redirects through manual links as well as dynamic links.
